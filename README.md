## 1. 📄 Abstract

Around 70 million Deaf individuals worldwide rely on sign languages, yet fewer than 20% of their digital content receives accurate captions. This is because current automated systems struggle with dynamic, continuous signing, leading to grammatically incorrect and unusable translations.

We present SignBridge, an American Sign Language (ASL) translation system that combines high-density pose estimation with an LLM for contextual selection from multiple sign candidates. SignBridge addresses three central challenges: individual word-level sign language accuracy in data-scarce scenarios, lack of grammatically correct sentence construction from sign predictions, and inadequate, multi-dimensional translation quality metrics. SignBridge's core innovation enables coherence-based selection rather than relying solely on vision model confidence scores for individual words.

Our approach enhances the OpenHands model to OpenHands-HD (expanding from 27 to 83 body points including detailed finger tracking), applies 50x pose data augmentation for training diversity, and uses transformer architecture to generate Top-K sign predictions. Google's Gemini LLM (gemini-2.0-flash) then performs contextual recovery by selecting semantically appropriate signs from the Top-K predictions.

Testing on the WLASL-100 dataset shows substantial improvements: word-level prediction accuracy increased from 71.57% benchmark to 80.97% for Top-1 predictions and 91.62% for Top-3 predictions. Sentence-level grammatical quality (Quality Score) rose from 39.38 to 74.56. To address the absence of comprehensive translation quality assessment frameworks, we introduce Composite Translation Quality Index (CTQI)—a new score that integrates lexical similarity, semantic preservation, grammatical structure, and completeness—improved from 55.56 to 78.16. All improvements achieve statistical significance (p < 0.001, paired t-tests) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) across all measures.

Taken together, SignBridge offers a foundation for more reliable and practical real-time ASL translation systems, helping reduce communication barriers for the Deaf community in education, employment and digital communication.

## 2. 🎯 Research Questions, Hypotheses & Engineering Goals

### Research Questions

- **RQ1:** Can tracking more body points improve sign language recognition accuracy (benchmark 72%) when training data is limited?
- **RQ2:** Can AI language models improve translation accuracy by considering sentence meaning rather than evaluating each sign independently?
- **RQ3:** Can measuring multiple aspects of translation quality together provide better assessment than single measurements?

### Hypotheses

- **H1: Enhanced Body Tracking.** Tracking 3x more body points instead of standard 27, combined with artificially expanding the training dataset by 10-20 times, will improve word-level recognition accuracy compared to current methods.
- **H2: AI-Powered Word Selection.** Using an AI Large Language Model to select words based on sentence meaning will produce higher quality translations than choosing the highest-confidence prediction from traditional science frameworks and machine learning models — particularly when the correct sign appears among the top predictions but not as the first choice.
- **H3: Multi-Dimensional Quality Measurement.** A combined quality score measuring word accuracy, meaning preservation, and grammatical correctness will reveal improvements that no single measurement captures alone.

### Engineering Goals

1. Build a sign recognition system that tracks 83 body points including detailed finger positions
2. Integrate an AI language model to construct grammatically correct sentences from sign predictions
3. Develop Composite Translation Quality Index (CTQI), a combined quality scoring framework measuring multiple translation dimensions
4. Create a working prototype demonstrating practical ASL-to-English translation (SignBridge)

### Expected Outcomes

- Recognition accuracy reaching 80%+ among top-3 predictions
- Grammatical quality of translations significantly improved over word-by-word output
- Validation that combined quality measurement outperforms single metrics for usage in real world applications
- A functional system demonstrating the viability of AI-enhanced sign language translation

## 3. 🔬 Experimental Design Overview

All development and experimentation for this research project were conducted on personal computing equipment using publicly available and synthetically augmented datasets. This develops and evaluates a three-component ASL translation system:

### Component 1: OpenHands-HD for Pose-Based Sign Recognition

- **Original Dataset:** WLASL (Word-Level ASL), with the WLASL-100 subset (100 sign classes, 342 samples expanded 50x to 17,100 via augmentation, 30% held out for validation/test)
- **Synthetic Data Augmentation:** Pre-generated augmentation with rotation (±15°), shear (±0.2 rad), producing 50x expansion
- **OpenHands-HD Development:** Enhanced MediaPipe Holistic extraction of 83 keypoints (8 face + 33 body + 42 hands), yielding 279-dimensional feature vectors per frame
- **Model Training:** Transformer encoder, small vs. large capacity (64–129 hidden, 2–3 layers, 8 heads), 1500 epochs, batch size 16
- **Output:** Top-K predictions with confidence scores per video

### Component 2: LLM Integration Library for Semantic Sentence Construction

- **Plug-and-play LLM integration;** prototype uses Google Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash)
- **Input:** Top-3 predictions per sign position with confidence scores, rolling window predictions
- **Semantic Coherence Analysis:** LLM selects signs based on semantic coherence (not just confidence), multi-pass prompt engineering, prevents duplicate selections, adds grammatical elements
- **Output:** Grammatically correct English sentences

### Component 3: CTQI Framework for Comprehensive Evaluation

- **CTQI Formula:** `CTQI = (α × BLEU) + (β × BERTScore) + (γ × Quality)`
  - **BLEU** for lexical similarity
  - **BERTScore** for semantic preservation
  - **Quality** for grammatical correctness (0–100)
- **Evaluation:** 25-entry synthetic sentence dataset with ground truth, comparing before-LLM (confidence-based) vs. after-LLM (semantic coherence), with statistical analysis of all quality metrics

## 4. 📈 SignBridge Performance

### Isolated Word-Level Sign Recognition Accuracy

OpenHands-HD achieves 80.97% Top-1 accuracy on WLASL-100, surpassing the original OpenHands pose-based baseline (71.57%) and approaching the video-based state-of-the-art (81.38%) while maintaining real-time inference speed.

| Model | Dataset | Approach | Keypoints | Top-1 Accuracy | Top-3 Accuracy | Speed |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| I3D Baseline | WLASL-100 | Video | N/A | 65.89% | — | Slow |
| Multi-stream CNN (SOTA) | WLASL-100 | Video | N/A | 81.38% | — | Slow |
| OpenHands Baseline | WLASL-100 | Pose + Transformer | 27 | 71.57% | — | Real-time |
| **OpenHands-HD (Ours)** | WLASL-100 | Pose + Transformer | 83 | **80.97%** | **91.62%** | Real-time |

### End-to-End Sentence-Level Translation

Statistical analysis of SignBridge results using paired t-tests (n=34 sentence pairs) demonstrates significant improvements across all evaluation metrics. For gloss-level selection accuracy, Coverage F1—which measures the overlap of content words between the generated and reference sentences—improved from 74.64 to 87.62 (t(33) = 4.944, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.848), representing a large effect size. This improvement indicates that the LLM pipeline more accurately selects contextually appropriate glosses from the model's top-k predictions, resulting in translations that better capture the intended meaning.

For overall translation quality, the Quality Score (a reference-free grammaticality measure based on GPT-2 perplexity) improved substantially from 39.38 to 74.56 (t(33) = 6.700, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.149), representing a large effect size. Additionally, the Perfect Translation Rate—a binary metric indicating whether all glosses in a sentence were correctly predicted—increased from 41.2% (14/34) to 67.6% (23/34), with p=0.004, confirming this improvement is statistically significant. The Composite Translation Quality Index (CTQI, introduced by SignBridge), which combines Gloss Accuracy (40%), Quality Score (40%), and Perfect Translation Rate (20%), improved from 55.56 to 78.16 (t(33) = 6.403, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.098). Overall, 88.2% of test entries (30/34) showed improvement in CTQI, demonstrating consistent gains across the evaluation dataset.

| Metric | Baseline (No LLM) | With LLM | Improvement | p-value |
|--------|-------------------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Coverage F1 | 74.64 | 87.62 | +12.98 | p < 0.001 |
| Quality Score | 39.38 | 74.56 | +35.18 | p < 0.001 |
| Perfect Translation Rate | 41.2% (14/34) | 67.6% (23/34) | +26.4% | p = 0.004 |
| **CTQI (introduced by SignBridge)** | **55.56** | **78.16** | **+22.60** | **p < 0.001** |
