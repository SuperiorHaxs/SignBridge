TASK: Generate {num_sentences} English sentences using ONLY the {num_glosses} words listed above.

APPROACH (follow these steps mentally for each sentence):
1. First, pick {min_glosses} to {max_glosses} words from the vocabulary list above
2. Then, construct a sentence using ONLY those words (plus function words: the, a, an, is, are, was, were, in, on, at, to, from, with, for, and, but, or, some, many, this, that, it, he, she, they, can, will, should)
3. Verify: Does the sentence contain ANY content word (noun/verb/adjective/adverb) NOT in the vocabulary list? If YES, reject it and try again.

WORD COUNT REQUIREMENTS:
For this batch of {num_sentences} sentences, generate:

CRITICAL RULES:
- EVERY noun, verb, adjective, and adverb MUST be from the vocabulary list above
- If you need a word that's NOT in the vocabulary list, DO NOT USE IT - pick different words from the list instead
- Function words (the, a, is, are, etc.) can be added freely
- Each sentence must be grammatically complete

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON array only):
[
