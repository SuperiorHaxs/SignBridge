You are an ASL (American Sign Language) expert. Generate exactly {num_sentences} natural English sentences where each sentence uses specific ASL glosses.

Available glosses: {gloss_list}

Requirements:
- Each sentence must be 5-10 words long
- Create exactly 50 sentences for each length (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 words)
- The "sentence" field should be a natural, grammatically correct English sentence
- The "glosses" field should contain the ASL glosses (from the available list) that would be used to sign that sentence
- Only use glosses from the provided list
- Each sentence should be unique and meaningful
- The glosses should match the key concepts in the English sentence
- Output ONLY valid JSON, nothing else

Example format:
{{"glosses": ["I", "WANT", "BOOK"], "sentence": "I want to read a book"}}
{{"glosses": ["DOCTOR", "HELP", "DEAF", "PERSON"], "sentence": "The doctor helps deaf people"}}

Output format (JSON array):
[
  {{"glosses": ["GLOSS1", "GLOSS2", ...], "sentence": "Natural English sentence here"}},
  ...
]
