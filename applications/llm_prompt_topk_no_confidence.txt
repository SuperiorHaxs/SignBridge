YOUR GOAL: Construct a grammatically correct English sentence.

MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE: These words come from American Sign Language (ASL) video signs describing a scene, action, or concept. ALL selected words must work together thematically to describe a coherent real-world scenario.

Look for:
- Related objects (chair + table, mother + deaf)
- Natural actions (dog + walk, candy + give)
- Logical scenes (apple + eat, help + person)

CRITICAL RULE: For each position, you MUST select EXACTLY ONE word from the options provided. Do NOT use any word that is not listed in a position's options. Every content word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb) in your output MUST come from the position options below.

For each position below, you are given multiple prediction options.

Word Predictions:
{gloss_details}

YOUR TASK:
1. Select one word from each position
2. Construct a natural, grammatically correct English sentence using ONLY those selected words

Step-by-step process:

STEP 1: READ ALL POSITIONS
- Look for related concepts (e.g., CHAIR + TABLE = furniture, DOG + WALK = animal action)
- Identify the main topic and action being described

STEP 2: SELECT ONE WORD FROM EACH POSITION
- For EACH position, select EXACTLY ONE word from the given options
- SEMANTIC COHERENCE IS MORE IMPORTANT than word order or frequency
- Example: If you see "chair" at position 1 and options "computer", "table", "year" at position 2,
  choose "table" because CHAIR + TABLE are semantically related (both furniture)

STEP 3: CONSTRUCT A GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT ENGLISH SENTENCE
- Use the words you selected from each position as the CONTENT WORDS (nouns, verbs, adjectives)
- Add appropriate articles (a, an, the) where needed
- Add appropriate prepositions (on, in, at, to, from, with, etc.) where needed
- Add minimal conjunctions (and, or, but) if needed
- Ensure proper verb tenses and subject-verb agreement (e.g., "walk" → "walks" if needed)
- Arrange words in natural English word order (subject-verb-object)
- Do NOT add content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) that are not from the selected glosses
- Keep the sentence concise and natural - aim for fewer than 15 words total

STEP 4: VERIFY YOUR OUTPUT
Before submitting, check:
- Did I use exactly one word from each position?
- Did I add any words that don't appear in the position options? (If yes, remove them!)
- Is my sentence fewer than 15 words?
- Is it a COMPLETE, GRAMMATICAL sentence (not just words in a row)?

IMPORTANT: Your output must be a COMPLETE ENGLISH SENTENCE with proper grammar.

Example:
Given positions:
Position 1: 'mother', 'blue', 'go'
Position 2: 'help', 'doctor', 'book'
Position 3: 'wrong', 'candy', 'deaf'

❌ WRONG OUTPUT: "mother help deaf" (just words, no grammar!)
❌ WRONG OUTPUT: "Mother help deaf." (no grammar, missing articles/verbs)
✓ CORRECT OUTPUT: "The mother will help the deaf person."

Explanation: Selected mother, help, deaf (best semantic coherence). Added articles (the), auxiliary verb (will), and noun (person) to make a complete grammatical sentence.

Return ONLY the grammatically correct English sentence, nothing else.
