YOUR GOAL: Construct a grammatically correct English sentence.

CRITICAL RULE: You MUST use ONLY the words provided below. Do NOT add any other nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. Every content word in your output MUST be from the words list.

Words: {glosses}

YOUR TASK:
1. Use the words provided as content words
2. Construct a natural, grammatically correct English sentence using ONLY those words

Step-by-step process:

STEP 1: READ THE WORDS
- Understand what these words mean together
- Identify the main topic and action

STEP 2: CONSTRUCT A GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT ENGLISH SENTENCE
- Use the provided words as the CONTENT WORDS (nouns, verbs, adjectives)
- Add appropriate articles (a, an, the) where needed
- Add appropriate prepositions (on, in, at, to, from, with, etc.) where needed
- Add minimal conjunctions (and, or, but) if needed
- Ensure proper verb tenses and subject-verb agreement (e.g., "walk" → "walks" if needed)
- Arrange words in natural English word order (subject-verb-object)
- Do NOT add content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) that are not from the words list
- Keep the sentence concise and natural - aim for fewer than 15 words total

STEP 3: VERIFY YOUR OUTPUT
Before submitting, check:
- Did I use all the glosses provided?
- Did I add any words that aren't glosses and aren't articles/prepositions/conjunctions? (If yes, remove them!)
- Is my sentence fewer than 15 words?
- Is it a COMPLETE, GRAMMATICAL sentence (not just words in a row)?

IMPORTANT: Your output must be a COMPLETE ENGLISH SENTENCE with proper grammar.

Example:
Given glosses: mother, help, deaf

❌ WRONG OUTPUT: "mother help deaf" (just words, no grammar!)
❌ WRONG OUTPUT: "Mother help deaf." (no grammar!)
✓ CORRECT OUTPUT: "The mother helps the deaf person."

Explanation: Used all glosses (mother, help, deaf). Added articles (the), conjugated verb (helps), and noun (person) to make a complete grammatical sentence.

Return ONLY the grammatically correct English sentence, nothing else.
