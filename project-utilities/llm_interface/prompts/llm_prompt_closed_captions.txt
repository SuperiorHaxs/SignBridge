TASK: Generate a meaningful English sentence from ASL video sign predictions.

IMPORTANT: These predictions come from an imperfect model. Some predictions may be wrong.
Your goal is to create a MEANINGFUL, COHERENT sentence - not just a grammatically correct one.

HOW TO SELECT WORDS:

1. MEANING FIRST: Only include words that contribute to a coherent meaning.
   - If a position's options don't fit the context, SKIP that position entirely
   - It's better to have a shorter meaningful sentence than a longer nonsensical one
   - Ask yourself: "Does this sentence make real-world sense?"

2. SEMANTIC COHERENCE: Look for words that naturally go together.
   - Examples: mother+help+child (caregiving), basketball+play+time (sports)
   - Reject combinations like: basketball+finish+year+change (no clear meaning)

3. USE ALTERNATIVES: Try all options from each position's top-k predictions.
   - Lower confidence alternatives often make more sense than high-confidence ones
   - Example: Position shows 'change' (80%) but 'practice' (15%) fits better with 'basketball'

4. SKIP NOISE: If ALL options for a position seem like prediction errors, skip it.
   - Signs for similar-looking words are often confused
   - Random predictions that don't fit ANY context should be omitted

5. POSITION FLEXIBILITY: You can arrange selected words in any grammatical order.

6. RELATIONAL NOUNS: Add "my" or "the" for family/relationship words as subjects.
   - "mother help" → "My mother helps..."
   - "friend visit" → "My friend visits..."

INPUT FORMAT:
- Word options with confidence scores for each position
- Confidence = model certainty, NOT semantic relevance
- You may skip positions that don't contribute to meaning

CRITICAL RULES:
1. MEANING OVER COMPLETENESS: A 3-word meaningful sentence beats a 6-word nonsense sentence
2. Select at most ONE word per position (no mixing alternatives)
3. Your "selections" array lists words you actually used (can be fewer than total positions)
4. If NO coherent sentence is possible, return your best attempt with "low_confidence": true

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - Normal case (use all positions):
Position 1: 'mother' (84%), 'blue' (6%), 'go' (2%)
Position 2: 'help' (99%), 'doctor' (1%), 'book' (0%)
Position 3: 'child' (70%), 'candy' (16%), 'deaf' (11%)

✓ CORRECT: {{"selections": ["mother", "help", "child"], "sentence": "My mother helps the child."}}

Example 2 - Skip nonsensical position:
Position 1: 'basketball' (75%), 'ball' (15%), 'orange' (5%)
Position 2: 'play' (82%), 'game' (10%), 'fun' (5%)
Position 3: 'change' (60%), 'different' (20%), 'time' (15%)
Position 4: 'year' (45%), 'finish' (30%), 'old' (20%)

✓ CORRECT: {{"selections": ["basketball", "play"], "sentence": "I play basketball."}}
   Why: Positions 3-4 don't fit coherently, so they were skipped

❌ WRONG: {{"selections": ["basketball", "play", "change", "year"], "sentence": "The basketball play will change this year."}}
   Why: Grammatically correct but semantically meaningless

Example 3 - Use lower-confidence alternative:
Position 1: 'tall' (70%), 'son' (20%), 'man' (8%)
Position 2: 'change' (55%), 'grow' (25%), 'big' (15%)
Position 3: 'change' (80%), 'different' (12%), 'new' (5%)

✓ CORRECT: {{"selections": ["son", "grow", "tall"], "sentence": "My son is growing tall."}}
   Why: Lower-confidence words create meaningful sentence about a child growing

❌ WRONG: {{"selections": ["tall", "change", "change"], "sentence": "The tall change is a change."}}
   Why: Uses high-confidence words but creates nonsense

Example 4 - Low confidence output:
Position 1: 'purple' (30%), 'grape' (25%), 'color' (20%)
Position 2: 'finish' (40%), 'done' (35%), 'complete' (20%)
Position 3: 'elephant' (50%), 'big' (30%), 'animal' (15%)

✓ ACCEPTABLE: {{"selections": ["elephant", "big"], "sentence": "The elephant is big.", "low_confidence": true}}
   Why: Best possible sentence, but marked as uncertain

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):
{{
  "selections": ["word1", "word2"],
  "sentence": "Your meaningful sentence here.",
  "low_confidence": false
}}

Requirements:
- "selections" = words you used (may be fewer than total positions)
- "sentence" = meaningful sentence using selected words
- "low_confidence" = true if you're unsure about the interpretation
- Output ONLY the JSON object
