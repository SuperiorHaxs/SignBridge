TASK: Construct a grammatically correct, meaningful English sentence from the selected glosses.

You are given a list of glosses that have already been selected for semantic coherence.
Your job is to construct a natural English sentence using these glosses.

RULES:

1. USE SELECTED GLOSSES: Build your sentence using the provided glosses.
   - You may drop glosses that don't fit a meaningful sentence.
   - It's better to have a shorter meaningful sentence than force nonsensical words.

2. ADD GRAMMATICAL FILLERS: You may add:
   - Articles: the, a, an
   - Prepositions: on, in, with, to, at, for
   - Conjunctions: and, or, but
   - Pronouns: I, my, you, your, he, she, it, they
   - Auxiliary verbs: is, are, was, were, will, can

3. DO NOT ADD: Words that change semantic meaning:
   - Negations: not, never, no (unless a gloss)
   - Modals that alter meaning: might, could, should (unless a gloss)

4. POSITION FLEXIBILITY: Arrange glosses in any grammatical order.

5. RELATIONAL NOUNS: Add possessive for family/relationship words as subjects.
   - "mother help" -> "My mother helps..."
   - "friend visit" -> "My friend visits..."

6. VERB FORMS: Use correct verb patterns:
   - Gerunds after: enjoy, avoid, finish -> "enjoys playing"
   - Infinitives after: want, hope, decide -> "wants to play"

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only - no other text):
{{
  "sentence": "Your grammatically correct sentence.",
  "used_glosses": ["GLOSS1", "GLOSS2"],
  "dropped_glosses": []
}}

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - Use all glosses:
Selected: ["MOTHER", "HELP", "CHILD"]

CORRECT: {{"sentence": "My mother helps the child.", "used_glosses": ["MOTHER", "HELP", "CHILD"], "dropped_glosses": []}}

Example 2 - Drop nonsensical gloss:
Selected: ["BASKETBALL", "PLAY", "CHANGE"]

CORRECT: {{"sentence": "I play basketball.", "used_glosses": ["BASKETBALL", "PLAY"], "dropped_glosses": ["CHANGE"]}}
Reason: "CHANGE" doesn't fit meaningfully with basketball/play.

Example 3 - With context:
Previous: "My mother helps the child."
Selected: ["GO", "SCHOOL", "NOW"]

CORRECT: {{"sentence": "She goes to school now.", "used_glosses": ["GO", "SCHOOL", "NOW"], "dropped_glosses": []}}
Used "She" to maintain narrative continuity from previous sentence.

Example 4 - Reorder for grammar:
Selected: ["BLUE", "BOOK", "TABLE"]

CORRECT: {{"sentence": "The blue book is on the table.", "used_glosses": ["BLUE", "BOOK", "TABLE"], "dropped_glosses": []}}
Reordered for natural English grammar.
